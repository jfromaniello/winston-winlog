# Windows Log transport for Winston

  Windows Event Log logger for node.js [Winston](https://github.com/flatiron/winston) module.

## Installation

    $ npm install winston-winlog
    $ npm install winston


## Usage

Configure :

```js
  var winston = require('winston'),
      winlog = require("winston-winlog");

  winston.add(winlog.EventLog, { source: 'myapp' });
  winston.setLevels(winlog.config.levels);
```

Then you can do:

```bash
  winston.info("this is an info message");
  winston.warn("this is an warning message");
  winston.error("this is an error message");
```

And you will see

### Custom event log

When adding the transport you can define a custom event log as follows:

```js
  winston.add(winlog.EventLog, { source: 'myapp', eventLog: 'MyCustomEventLog' });
```

Then you will find your logs under "Applications and Services Logs"

## How it works

This transport uses the module [windows-eventlog](http://jfromaniello.github.com/windowseventlogjs/) to log events. 

In order to write entries to the eventlog your application has to run with an elevated account: ie administrator or system account. 

The transport will do nothing (*doesn't throw!*) if you run it on a platform other than win32.

## Esta bueno, pero...

The only reason to use this adapter and not windows-eventlog directly is if you are working on a multi-platform project or you are already using winston.
